tainty as tohis parentage, his country, or even
his name,¹ the period when he lived, or the

works of which he was the author. Itis con· ,

tended by some that only one individual bear«
ing this name attained any eminence during the

were at least two personages of the name, and
that the exploits of the one have, in some de«
gree, b'een ascribed to the other. Without en·
tering into this controversy, we shall endeavour
to profit by the information which it has elicited,
adopting those results which, upon an examina·
tion of the rival theories, bear the greatest ap·
pearancc of probability.
