PREFAGE. xxiii

editor haS, therefore, preserved unaltered various
passages, which apparently might be rendered
more intelligihle by conjectural emendation. The

the NoteS, it need only be remarked that brevity
has been studied, and that their object, for the
most part, is to refer the reader to those sources
where he will find the subJect more elaborately
discussed.
