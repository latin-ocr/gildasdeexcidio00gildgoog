have indeed received from Beda a different inter·
pretation from that which we have here assign-
ed to thern. That writer understands them as
“ meaning that the siege of Kair Badon occurred
forty-four years afterthe arrival of the Saxons in
England,l whereas they seem rather to show that
Gildas wrote his Epistle forty-four years after
⁴ that siege, he being then in the forty-fourth year
of his age.² Admitting that Beda has here, as
elsewhere,³ been misled by the turgid and in-
volved style of the author, it remains ior us to lix
the date ofthe siege of Kair Badon, which, as has
been already stated, was coeval with the birth os
Gildas. vThe argument in favour of the year
520 rests partly upon the direct authority of Mat-
thew of Westminster,⁴ and partly upon the data
furnished by an anonymous British chronicler,⁵
who affirms that twenty-two years elapsed be-
